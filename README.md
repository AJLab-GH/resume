# resume

This repository will build PDF resume(s) using the data found resume.json (which follows a schema compatible with themes used in themes.json).

Upon commiting a change to the 'main' branch of this repository, a GitHub Action will kick off a series of jobs that will result in resumes for all themes to be recommited back into your 'main' branch in an outputs folder.
